# Flappy-Bird🐥

This is a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to control a bird and navigate it through an endless series of pipes without colliding into them. The game becomes increasingly challenging as the player progresses.


## Features

✪Start Screen: A simple, intuitive menu with a play button to start the game.

✪Gameplay: The bird is controlled by either pressing a key or clicking with the mouse to make it fly upwards, while gravity pulls it down.

✪Dynamic Pipe Generation: Pipes are generated at regular intervals, with gaps between them to allow the bird to pass through.

✪Score Tracking: The score increases each time the bird successfully passes through a pipe. The score is displayed in the game.

✪Game Over Screen: When the bird collides with a pipe or falls off the screen, a game-over screen appears with the player's final score.
## How to Play:

1.Press any key or click on the screen to make the bird fly.

2.Avoid the pipes by flying through the gaps.

3.Try to get the highest score possible before crashing!
